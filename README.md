#Trigsolver
This Python script is a Triangle Solver that calculates the properties of a triangle based on user input. 
The program makesuse of the Law of Sines and Cosines to calculate the side lengths and angles and is able
to compute the following cases:
    - **SSS (Side-Side-Side)**: All three side lengths are known.
    - **SAS (Side-Angle-Side)**: Two sides and the angle between them are known.
    - **ASA (Angle-Side-Angle)**: Two angles and the side between them are known.
    - **AAS (Angle-Angle-Side)**: Two angles and a non-included side are known.
    - **SSA (Side-Side-Angle)**: Two sides and a non-included angle are known.

It also includes a function to calculate the area of an oblique triangle using Heron's formula.
This script is a useful tool for solving triangles in trigonometry and can be used in educational settings 
or for practical applications where triangle properties need to be calculated.
